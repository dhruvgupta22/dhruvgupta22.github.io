I did this project in my 4th semester as a part of the course CS253. It was my first experience to work in a such a large team of 10 students and honestly I enjoyed it a lot. We mostly worked in subteams of 2-3 each working on a separate component. We were allowed to use any coding language or framework for our project and we decided to go with MERN stack.

## **Project Overview**

**Billing360** is a web application specifically designed to streamline the billing process for micro-enterprises. With a focus on efficiency and ease of use, the application offers a range of features including:

- **Invoice Generation**  
- **Inventory Management**  
- **Credit Management**  
- **Transaction History Management**  
- **Report Generation**

The project was developed from scratch using a plan-driven, agile development approach. We began with the creation of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and design documents, followed by implementation, deployment, and testing.

## **My Contributions**
- ### Design of the website
  I collaborated with two other members to design the complete layout and user interface of the website. This included deciding how the website would look and ensuring the design was intuitive, visually appealing, and aligned with the project's goals. We focused on user experience, ensuring that the design was responsive, easy to navigate, and suitable for micro-enterprises.
- ### Designing Schemas
  I contributed to the creation of some of the database schemas for various entities in the application. This involved designing the structure for key components such as invoices, inventory, and transactions, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and ease of use for the application.
- ### Invoice Generation
  I collaborated with another team member to design the complete invoice generation page. It was the most vital functionality of a billing software - to generate bills. We created a lot of APIs - for pdf invoice generation, fetching items list from inventory, updating inventory, updating transaction history, and many more.
  In the frontend part, the most complicated part was to create a searchable dropdown option to add items in the invoice.
- ### Performance Testing
  I performed performance testing for the key APIs involved in pdf invoice generation, since these were the bottlenecks of our website.
- ### Other Contributions
  I reported and resolved some major bugs during the testing phase to maintain consistency of data and resolve synchronicity issues. I also contributed in all stages of documentation from SRS to testing. 
  
## **Key Takeaways**

This project provided me with invaluable insights into software development. I learned that:

- #### Software Development is More than Just Coding 
  It's about understanding user needs, creating an intuitive user experience, and collaborating effectively with a team.

- #### Importance of Teamwork  
  Working in a large team of 10 members gave me a deeper appreciation for collaboration, communication, and the role each individual plays in the success of a project.

- #### Real-World Development Practices  
  I gained hands-on experience with Agile methodologies, bug fixing, performance testing, and deployment, which has significantly enhanced my understanding of full-stack development.
